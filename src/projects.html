            <p>mealmate pairs MIT students up to eat at dining halls. It helps people who are looking to make new friends, 
                not eat alone, or reconnect with existing friends. This project was my first exposure to all the wonders of 
                web development, and I created it in a team of three during IAP in 6.148 - Web Development. I was in charge 
                of the front-end and loved learning about HTML, CSS, and Javascript, often staying up until the AMs (willingly!)
                because I thought web dev was so fun. In the end, my team won the “Most Valuable for MIT” award and was a 
                semifinalist in the competition portion of the class.

            <p><strong>Used:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery</p>
            <p>FBI is a Chrome extension that allows users to hide Facebook posts that may elicit a strong or harmful 
                emotional response. Users can insert words or phrases representative of posts that they do not want to see
                on their timeline. Posts with flagged content will be hidden, displaying only the flagged keywords 
                and the content creator, but can be opened up by clicking on them. I developed this project
                in a team of four at my first hackathon, WHACK 2017, and we won the #HackHarassment award for 
                promoting safe spaces and harassment reduction.

            <p><strong>Used:</strong> React JSX, SCSS, Javascript, HTML, Node, Babel, Webpack, React-Modal</p>
            <p>Indecision is a React decision-making web app that helps you make decisions based of off your inputted options!
                This is the first project created off of taking <a href="https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/learn/v4/overview">
                The Complete React Web Developer Course (with Redux)</a> on Udemy by Andrew Mead. Because I had never
                worked with React before, I learned so much about front-end and new technologies - previously, I had 
                done web development primarily with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, so it was interesting to see the 
                similarities and differences.

            <p><strong>Used:</strong> React JSX, SCSS, Javascript, HTML, Node, Babel, Webpack, AWS Services
                (Lambda, Kinesis, API Gateway, DynamoDB, IAM)</p>
            <p>Hello, Retail! is a Nordstrom Technology open-source project. Hello, Retail! is a 100% serverless, 
                event-driven framework and functional proof-of-concept showcasing a central unified log approach 
                as applied to the retail problem space. All code and patterns are intended to be re-usable for 
                scalable applications large and small. This past summer, I was at Nordstrom Technology as a 
                software engineering intern, working on adding an Add to Cart feature, uploading Nordstrom's 
                catalog of 130,000 products to HR, and updating its front-end.

            <p><strong>Used:</strong> Android Studio, Java, XML, SQL, SQLite</p>
            <p>Checks is an Android application that is like an accountable to-do list. Each section is for a 
                particular person, who will get email updates about which tasks are completed. Checks works well
                for informing parents, family, coaches, or doctors about tasks that are being completed, and the 
                frequency of the emails can be adjusted. The app utilizes external social pressure to make it 
                more likely that you actually complete your goals. I created this project in a team of three 
                at HackPrinceton Spring 2017.

            <p>ThirsT is a smart water bottle that will automatically track the amount of water - 
                or other beverage of your choice - you consume in a day, as well as provide reminders 
                when you haven't been drinking enough water based off of information you can input 
                about your height, weight, age, and gender. ThirsT will also adjust the amount of liquid
                needed based on location and the current temperature. I created this project in a team 
                of four in 6.08 - Interconnected Embedded Systems.

            <p>Fritter, or Fake Twitter, is a Vue.js application that I created in my 6.170, Software Studio,
                class. Over 4 weeks, I 1) implemented server-side functionality and an API to handle user accounts
                and allow users to create, read, update, and delete short messages called Freets, 2) designed a graphical
                UI for Fritter and use Vue,js, 3) use a SQL database for persistent storage, and 4) test and attack 
                Fritter and fix security vulnerabilites.

            <p><strong>Used:</strong> HTML, CSS, Javascript</p>
            <p>The Game of Life is a static HTML, CSS, and Javascript web app that I created in 6.170, Software Studio.
                This is modelled after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" alt="Conway's
                Game of Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>, with the same rules. In this implementation, a user can click 
                squares to make them turn from dead to alive, and then click "Start", "Pause", and "Continue" at any 
                time to see what happens. A user can also select 1 of 5 preset boards and then click the "Start", 
                "Pause", and "Continue" buttons to see what happens.
